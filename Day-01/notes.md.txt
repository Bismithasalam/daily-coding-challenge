# Day 1 Notes - January 27, 2025

## Problems Solved:
1. **HackerRank:** Solve Me First
2. **LeetCode:** Two Sum (Brute force approach)

## What I Learned:
- Basic input/output in Python
- How to approach a problem with brute force first
- Nested loops and their time complexity (O(nÂ²))

## Thoughts:
The brute force solution for Two Sum worked, but I know there's a better way using hash maps. I'll revisit this later!
